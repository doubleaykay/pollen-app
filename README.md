# pollen-app
A simple Android app that displays the pollen level for 3 days (today, tomorrow, and the day after) for US zip codes. Uses pollen data from Pollen.com

# how it started
I suffer from severe seasonal allergies, so having quick access to pollen data is critical to me. But I'm also a stickler for good design, and all of the existing pollen apps (that I could find) had horrible designs and were huge apps with all kinds of unnessecary features. So, I decided to build my own.
